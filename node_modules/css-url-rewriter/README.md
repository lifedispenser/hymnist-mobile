# css-url-rewriter [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/callumlocke/css-url-rewriter.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/callumlocke/css-url-rewriter)

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/css-url-rewriter.svg?downloads=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/css-url-rewriter/)

Simple function that looks for `url(...)` definitions in a string of CSS and runs them through your own rewriter function.


## Getting Started
Install the module with: `npm install css-url-rewriter`

```js
var rewriteCSSURLs = require('css-url-rewriter');

// example - add a query string to all URLs
var newCSS = rewriteCSSURLs(someCSS, function (url) {
  return url + '?12345';
});
```

It will process all URLs it encounters by default, even `data:` URIs, so you need to check for those manually if you want to handle them differently. The only exception is URLs in 'excluded properties' (see settings).


### Settings
You can optionally pass in a settings object as a second argument:

```js
var newCSS = rewriteCSSURLs(someCSS, settings, function (url) {
  return url + '?12345';
});
```

Currently there is only one configurable setting, `excludedProperties`, which is an array of properties that you want to skip. This setting defaults to `['behavior', '*behavior']` (because you usually don't want to mess with URLs in this proprietary MSIE property, because it has weird relativity rules).
